# Customer Strategy & Retention Marketing (CSRM) + Growth Analytics Portfolio

This repository is a curated portfolio of my work in **Customer Strategy & Retention Marketing (CSRM)** and **Growth Analytics**, focused on driving **reactivation, repeat usage, and revenue uplift** through structured customer lifecycle systems, segmentation-led targeting, and multi-channel campaign execution.

My work sits at the intersection of **Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM)**, marketing automation, and performance analytics — spanning:
- App Notifications (AN)
- WhatsApp nudges
- Emailers
- SMS (DLT-compliant)
- In-app placements
- Gamified landing pages

The portfolio includes both **high-frequency daily pushes** and **sale-oriented / gamified contest campaigns**, built to engage **active, inactive, and lapsed cohorts** with measurable business outcomes — with a strong focus on **finance-led retention** (credit cards, loans, EMI-based conversion journeys).

## Project 02 — Lapsed User Reactivation (Segmentation + Incentive Automation)
**File:** `EK Lapsed Journey.docx`

### Project Focus
Designed a lapsed-user automation journey to re-engage users by assigning monthly **Profit Targets**, segmenting users by **potential commission**, and nudging them through milestone-based goal progression.

### Key Deliverables
- Entry logic: **Lapsed = no transaction in last 30 days**
- Segmentation by potential commission buckets to route cohorts into WhatsApp vs SMS vs AN journeys
- Milestone progression nudges:
  - **1–80% goal**: push to reach 80% for unlock
  - **80% goal**: unlock bonus + **10% extra profit above 100%**
  - **100% goal**: unlock continued 10% extra earning logic
  - **>100% goal**: reinforcement nudges until journey end
- Non-reactivated logic:
  - Day 7–10 special nudges + incentives
  - Exit rule: if no transaction within **15 days**, user exits journey and moves to BAU notifications
- Bonus slab mapping by potential commission:
  - ₹2k–5k → ₹100
  - ₹5k–10k → ₹250
  - ₹10k–25k → ₹500
  - ₹25k–50k → ₹500
  - ₹1L–2L → ₹500
  - ₹2L+ → ₹1000

### Impact / Outcome Delivered
Built a scalable reactivation system combining segmentation, incentive economics, and automation logic — designed to improve repeat conversion while controlling incentive burn through performance-led targeting.
